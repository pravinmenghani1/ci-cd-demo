## Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Free Tier Benefits**:
   - New AWS accounts get 750 hours of t3.micro instances free for 12 months
   - 5 GB of S3 storage free for 12 months
   - 15 GB of data transfer out free for 12 months

2. **Reduce Costs**:
   - Scale down to 1 EC2 instance for development/testing
   - Use Spot Instances for non-production workloads
   - Implement lifecycle policies for S3 objects
   - Limit CodeBuild usage by optimizing build processes

3. **Cost Monitoring**:
   - Set up AWS Budgets to monitor and alert on costs
   - Use Cost Explorer to analyze spending patterns
   - Tag resources appropriately for cost allocation

## Important Notes

- Actual costs may vary based on usage patterns, region, and specific AWS pricing changes
- This estimate does not include costs for additional services you might add later
- Data transfer costs can increase significantly with higher traffic
- Consider reserved instances for long-term usage to reduce EC2 costs
