Infrastructure Components
========================

1. Network Layer
   - VPC with public subnets across 2 AZs
   - Internet Gateway
   - Route Tables

2. Security Layer
   - Security Groups for Load Balancer
   - Security Groups for Web Servers
   - IAM Roles with least privilege

3. Compute Layer
   - Auto Scaling Group
   - EC2 Instances with CodeDeploy Agent
   - Launch Template

4. Delivery Layer
   - CodePipeline for orchestration
   - CodeBuild for building and testing
   - CodeDeploy for deployment
   - S3 Bucket for artifacts

5. Access Layer
   - Application Load Balancer
   - Health Checks
   - Target Groups

CI/CD Workflow
=============

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub repository
2. CodePipeline detects changes and starts the pipeline
3. Source stage pulls the latest code from GitHub
4. Build stage runs CodeBuild to:
   - Validate HTML files
   - Package application files
   - Create deployment artifact
5. Deploy stage uses CodeDeploy to:
   - Deploy to EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling Group
   - Run deployment lifecycle scripts
   - Validate the deployment
6. Application is accessible via the Load Balancer URL
7. CloudWatch monitors the infrastructure and application
