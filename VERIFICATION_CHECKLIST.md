# CI/CD Pipeline Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to verify that your CI/CD pipeline is correctly set up and functioning as expected.

## Infrastructure Verification

### Network Infrastructure

- [ ] VPC created successfully
- [ ] Public subnets created in multiple availability zones
- [ ] Internet Gateway attached to VPC
- [ ] Route tables configured correctly
- [ ] Network ACLs allow necessary traffic

### Security Configuration

- [ ] Load Balancer security group allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- [ ] Web server security group allows traffic from the load balancer
- [ ] IAM roles have appropriate permissions
- [ ] No overly permissive security settings

### Compute Resources

- [ ] Auto Scaling Group created with correct settings
- [ ] Launch Template uses the correct AMI and instance type
- [ ] EC2 instances are running and healthy
- [ ] CodeDeploy agent installed and running on instances
- [ ] Instances distributed across multiple availability zones

### Load Balancer

- [ ] Application Load Balancer created successfully
- [ ] Target Group has healthy targets
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Load Balancer accessible via its DNS name

## CI/CD Pipeline Verification

### Source Stage

- [ ] GitHub repository connected to CodePipeline
- [ ] OAuth token working correctly
- [ ] Source stage succeeds when changes are pushed

### Build Stage

- [ ] CodeBuild project created successfully
- [ ] buildspec.yml correctly configured
- [ ] Build process completes successfully
- [ ] Artifacts generated correctly

### Deploy Stage

- [ ] CodeDeploy application created successfully
- [ ] Deployment group configured correctly
- [ ] appspec.yml correctly configured
- [ ] Deployment scripts working as expected
- [ ] Deployment completes successfully

## Application Verification

### Basic Functionality

- [ ] Application accessible via Load Balancer URL
- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] CSS and JavaScript files load without errors
- [ ] Images display correctly

### Deployment Process

### Data Protection

- [ ] S3 bucket encryption enabled
- [ ] Sensitive data properly protected
- [ ] HTTPS configured (if applicable)

## Performance Verification

### Load Testing

- [ ] Application performs well under expected load
- [ ] Auto Scaling responds to increased demand
- [ ] No performance bottlenecks identified

### Resilience Testing

- [ ] Application continues to function if an instance fails
- [ ] Auto Scaling replaces unhealthy instances
- [ ] Load Balancer routes traffic away from unhealthy instances

## Final Verification

### Documentation

- [ ] Deployment procedures documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide available
- [ ] Cost estimation documented

### Cleanup Verification
